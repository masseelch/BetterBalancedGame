# FastTrackBalancing
This is a Cililization VI Mod forked from [BetterBalancedGame](https://github.com/iElden/BetterBalancedGame). It uses most of the changes made in the orignal mod but excludes those made to civilizations. We like to keep the civilizations distinct and do not like for them all merged into one uniform mass where they only differ in the name.
